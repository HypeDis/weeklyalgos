/*
 Create a least recently used cache. The cache should be initialized with a maximum cache size n and have two methods:

 set(key, value) stores the key/value in the cache, 
 if we are adding a new item and there are already n items in the cache, 
 delete the least recently used entry

 get(key): get the value of the key, return null if it doesn't exist 

 both methods should be O(1)
