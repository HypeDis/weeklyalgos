/* 
Given a string which consists of lowercase or uppercase letters, 
find the length of the longest palindromes that can be built with those letters. 

** you do not need to return the palindrome, just the length

This is case sensitive, for example "aBba" is not considered a palindrome.

Example 1:
input = 'aabcccdd'
output = 7 ('aacccdd')

Example 2: 
input = 'gllKlmKkcbbaa
output = 9 ('lKabgbaKl')

Solution should take O(n) time
